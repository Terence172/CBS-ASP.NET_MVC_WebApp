This Repository contains files to the Car Booking System (CBS) that was created as a part of my assesment for Application Development Course. I used Microsoft Visual Studio to complete this assesment, and also Microsoft SSMS for the database technology. The following application is built on ASP.NET Web Application (.Net Framework)  with MVC implemented.

Feel free to suggest any improvements.
